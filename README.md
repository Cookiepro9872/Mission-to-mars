# Story 1



Found the coding bit easy but struggled quite a lot with git specifically with the command: (git remote add origin) as the guide showed you needed https:// before the url but that dose not work instead you just put the url.



# Story 2



Found this story quite easy just placing components and a bit of simple coding.



# Story 3



Didn't know about the existence of The Arduino IDE and Programming section so had to completely redo this story but once I did know about it was pretty simple.



# Story 4



Took a bit of time to setup functions but straight forward.



# Story 5



Found it quite easy and made it so you can control the motor speed from the function. eg: forward(delay, left motor speed, right motor speed);



# Story 6



Found this story much tricker took me 2 hours mostly because of spelling mistakes causing syntax errors and a few syntax errors. This is most likely because I'm doing this so late.



# Story 7



Had to email to confirm exactly what had to be done but once I understood it was really simple as I had functions for everything.



# Story 8



Found this story quite easy.



# Story 9



Pretty much the same as story 8.



# Story 10
