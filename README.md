Found the coding bit easy but struggled quite a lot with git specifically with the command: (git remote add origin) as the guide showed you needed https:// before the url but that dose not work instead you just put the url.

Found this story quite easy just placing components and a bit of simple coding.



# Story 3



Made a few stupid mistakes due to me using the top half of the breadboard but other than that pretty simple.
